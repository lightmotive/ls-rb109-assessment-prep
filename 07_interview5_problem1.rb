# frozen_string_literal: true

# Find the length of the longest substring in the given string that is the same in reverse,
#
# As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast", the substring (racecar) length would be 7.
#
# If the length of the input string is 0, return value must be 0.

# Examples:
# "a" -> 1
# "aab" -> 2
# "abcde" -> 1
# "zzbaabcd" -> 4
# "" -> 0

p longest_palindrome('a') == 1
p longest_palindrome('aa') == 2
p longest_palindrome('baa') == 2
p longest_palindrome('aab') == 2
p longest_palindrome('baabcd') == 4
p longest_palindrome('baablkj12345432133d') == 9
